# sine-waves

A while ago I posted on my blog about using sine waves to mimic a 3D motion effect - [you can read it here](https://justinebert.com/posts/sine-waves)
I decided to package up the react component and helper class I built and release them! They're very simple - but should be extensible enough for just about any purpose.

## Boilerplate library code

I didn't want to set everything up myself, so I used the wonderful [react-rollup-boilerplate](https://github.com/KaiHotz/react-rollup-boilerplate?tab=readme-ov-file) by KaiHotz. It's simple and feature rich - I definitely recommend.
